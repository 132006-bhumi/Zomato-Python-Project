# 📌 Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset from **Zomato**, which contains information about various restaurants, including:

- Restaurant names
- Online order availability
- Table booking options
- User votes and ratings
- Approximate cost for two people
- Listing types (Delivery, Buffet, etc.)
Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the data was cleaned, explored, and visualized to extract meaningful insights that can guide business decisions.
# 🎯 Objective

- 📊 Analyze restaurant behavior and customer engagement  
- 📈 Identify patterns in online ordering, table booking, and pricing  
- 🧹 Use Python libraries to clean, explore, and visualize data  
- 📉 Understand service trends and popularity metrics in the restaurant industry
# 📋 Agenda Questions
Here are the key questions addressed in this project:

1️⃣ **How many restaurants allow online orders?**  
2️⃣ **How many restaurants offer table booking?**  
3️⃣ **Which type of listing (e.g., Buffet, Delivery) is most common?**  
4️⃣ **What are the top 10 most voted restaurants?**  
5️⃣ **What is the distribution of approximate cost for two people?**  
6️⃣ **What is the relationship between online order availability and votes?**  
7️⃣ **Which restaurants have the highest average cost for two people?**  
8️⃣ **Comparison of cost distribution based on listing type**  
9️⃣ **Top 10 most popular restaurants (based on votes and online order availability)**  
🔟 **How many restaurants fall into each cost category (binned)?**
# ✅ Conclusion

- 🏷️ Mid-range pricing and online availability are strong drivers of user engagement.
